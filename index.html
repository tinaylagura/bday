        <p>Happy 21st birthday to you, ate! Even though you don't really like celebrating your birthday, especially karun nga medyo nagka problema and even if you can't be with your family to celebrate, I still want to make you feel special in a simple way through this message. I want you to know that this day is for you, and there are people who appreciate and love you.

            I just wish you happiness, more birthdays to come, and more bonding moments. Time is short for us to hang out because weâ€™re almost done with school, but I know even after we finish our studies, weâ€™ll still find a way to meet and spend time together(oa naa pay isa kapin ka tuig).
            
            By the way, I know recently you went through a tough situation, but I want you to remember that everything happens for a reason. If you feel like people donâ€™t stay, or if you feel unappreciated, I want you to know that I see how good of a person you are. Not everyone may notice, but I truly do. And even if you feel like people come and go, I want you to know Iâ€™ll be here for you no matter what. I accept you for who you are, no matter what youâ€™ve been through. I know there are still people out there who love and care for you, and in God's perfect time, youâ€™ll find those who will stay for good.
            
            Iâ€™m really proud of you. Despite all the problems youâ€™ve faced, I know there are many things you don't tell me, but youâ€™re handling them with so much strength. Youâ€™re strong, and youâ€™re doing everything for your family. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so proud of you. But I also want to remind you not to forget yourself and take care of your health.
            
            And just a little extra reminder: continue being true to yourself, even if you get a bit "delusional" with your crushesðŸ¤ª. As long as it makes you happy and doesnâ€™t harm you, Iâ€™ll support you. I just want you to be happy.
            
            And even though you canâ€™t be with your family today to celebrate, I want you to feel that youâ€™re not alone. Iâ€™m here for you, to make sure you feel special today.
            
            I hope you enjoy your day today. Once again, happy birthday maldita nako nga ate HAHAHHAHA !
            
            
            ps: favorite ferson nimo nga sufer cute, greenest green flag, your source of happiness, caring ang loving monkey.</p>
